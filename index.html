subheading: A discussion regarding the design, construction, and maintenance of custom nonstandard Linux systems

<div style="margin-right: 300px">Welcome to BwackNinja's Hideout, a dark place where we delve deeper into the inner workings of a Linux-based system than most people should ever need to and few will ever want to.

Feel free to ask questions (though I'll likely only answer questions I find interesting - I'm no substitute for a good web search). Prepare yourself for a journey into the broken unknown. You can still turn back...</div>
