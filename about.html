I'm an a programmer, a tinkerer, and a Linux enthusiast. The views expressed here are my own and do not represent the views of my employer. If the post is old enough, it might not even represent my views either. I'm always trying to learn more about Linux and feel that I some of the knowledge I've acquired is worth sharing with others.<br/><br/>

I'm not a help desk, but if you've got something interesting to say or an intriguing problem to discuss, I can be reached at my gmail address, BwackNinja. I won't make any promises, but feel free to contact me!
